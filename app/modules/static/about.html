    <h1>About annoTate</h1>
    <p>AnnoTate is a transcription tool developed to enable volunteers to read and transcribe the personal papers of British born and émigré artists, including Josef Herman, Barbara Hepworth and Kurt Schwitters. Drawn from the world’s largest archive of British Art - Tate Archive, participants can help to provide full text transcriptions of handwritten documents, helping to reveal the inspiration and stories behind some of the greatest works of the past century.</p>
    <p>Tate is the first fine arts organisation to collaborate with the Zooniverse team, based at the University of Oxford, in order to develop a crowdsourced transcription tool, which specifically addresses fine art materials and content. Volunteers can encounter letters, notebooks and sketches that reveal artists’ everyday lives, creative practices and the processes by which renowned works of art were made.</p>
    <p>AnnoTate is an outcome of Tate’s Archives &amp; Access project: an ambitious venture which takes 52,000 items from the largest archive of British art in the world and makes them accessible to national and international online audiences via a programme of digitisation, learning and participation. This is made possible through a £1.9 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>
