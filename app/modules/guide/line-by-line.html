<h1>Line-by-line transcription</h1>

<p>In order for us to get good quality data (transcriptions) out of our collective efforts, we need to all transcribe in the same way. One way to increase data quality and consistency is to break the task into smaller pieces. Instead of transcribing whole pages at a time, we ask that you only transcribe one line at a time, and to only transcribe what you can read with confidence.</p>

<p>'What is a line?' you ask. It's not a sentence or proper grammatical unit, but a line of text running left to right. If it's in the margin or a cramped space, a line might consist of one or two words! </p>

<p>In order for the Zooniverse approach to transcription to work--that is, for multiple volunteers to independently transcribe the manuscripts and have their individual lines of transcription compared using an algorithm, thus hopefully reducing the need for editorial intervention later--we need everyone to tackle small units of text. Thanks for your time!</p>
