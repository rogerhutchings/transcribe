<p>While transcribing, you may see some black dots. These are lines that other users have already transcribed - <b>you don't need to transcribe them as well</b>.</p>

<p>After you finish transcribing, if all lines are marked with either black or green dots, then choose 'Yes' when asked if everything's transcribed.</p>
