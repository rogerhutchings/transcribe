<h1>Illegible text</h1>

<p>Some text is genuinely illegible as opposed to just hard to read. This can be because the text has been crossed out or the surface on which it was written has been damaged. In these cases, just click 'Illegible'. If a whole line is illegible, place points at the start and end to transcribe, and click the Illegible button before moving on to transcribe something else.</p>

<p class="example">No need to put anything between the tags [illegible][/illegible]</p>
